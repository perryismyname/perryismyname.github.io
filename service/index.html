  <li>Packaging instruments in sterilization pouches with appropriate indicators</li>
  <li>Operating autoclave equipment following strict time/temperature/pressure protocols</li>
  <li>Verifying sterilization success through indicator strip validation</li>
  <li>Organizing and storing sterile packs with proper rotation to ensure freshness</li>
</ul>

<p>This work required meticulous attention to detail—improperly sterilized instruments could lead to post-operative infections, while damaged instruments could compromise surgical outcomes. Learned importance of procedural discipline and how small oversights cascade into larger problems.</p>

<p><strong>Facility Preparation & Maintenance:</strong> Supported daily surgical operations through morning prep and end-of-day cleaning. Morning duties included preparing sterilization materials, restocking surgical suites with required supplies, and ensuring equipment was ready for veterinary staff. End-of-day responsibilities involved thorough cleaning and disinfection of surgical rooms, proper disposal of biological waste, and restocking for next day's operations. Maintained clean, organized environment essential for safe veterinary procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Post-Operative Animal Monitoring:</strong> Observed animals in recovery areas following anesthesia and surgery. Watched for signs of distress, abnormal behavior, or complications requiring veterinary attention. Alerted nursing staff immediately when animals exhibited concerning symptoms (prolonged unconsciousness, labored breathing, unusual vocalizations). This monitoring role required understanding normal vs. abnormal recovery patterns and recognizing when professional intervention was needed.</p>

<h4>Small Animal Care Unit</h4>
<p>Entry-level position where volunteer service began. Responsible for daily care of rescued small animals including rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, and other species awaiting adoption. Duties included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Daily feeding and water provision appropriate to species dietary needs</li>
  <li>Supervised exercise and socialization time outside enclosures</li>
  <li>Habitat cleaning and bedding replacement to maintain sanitary conditions</li>
  <li>Behavioral observation and enrichment activities to reduce stress</li>
  <li>Documentation of health concerns or behavioral changes for veterinary review</li>
</ul>

<p>This role taught responsibility for living creatures dependent on consistent care. Missing a feeding or failing to clean properly directly impacted animal health and adoption readiness. Learned to follow structured care protocols and maintain detailed records.</p>

<h4>Cat Care & Deep Cleaning Support</h4>
<p>Provided backup support to cat care team during high-volume periods or staff shortages. Performed deep cleaning of cat housing areas—a physically demanding task requiring thorough disinfection, litter management, and environmental sanitization. This work was critical during disease outbreak prevention efforts when contamination control became essential to protect entire cat population.</p>

<h4>Emergency Relief Support</h4>
<p>Activated during regional wildfire emergencies when evacuated residents brought animals to designated shelter points. Oregon's wildfire season creates urgent need for emergency animal housing, feeding, and supply distribution. Volunteer role included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transporting donated supplies (food, bedding, crates, medications) to emergency evacuation centers</li>
  <li>Organizing and inventorying emergency supply stockpiles</li>
  <li>Assisting with temporary animal housing setup at evacuation sites</li>
  <li>Monitoring supply levels and coordinating replenishment as needed</li>
  <li>Supporting displaced pet owners during high-stress emergency situations</li>
</ul>

<p>Emergency response work demonstrated importance of preparedness, logistics coordination, and calm professionalism during crisis. Seeing families reunited with evacuated pets reinforced the community service value of volunteer work.</p>

<h4>Skills and Values Developed</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Procedural Discipline:</strong> Sterilization protocols required exact adherence to procedures—shortcuts risk animal health</li>
  <li><strong>Attention to Detail:</strong> Instrument inspection, animal monitoring, and cleaning standards all demand careful observation</li>
  <li><strong>Compassion Under Stress:</strong> Working with sick, injured, or frightened animals requires patience and empathy</li>
  <li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Coordinating with veterinary staff, fellow volunteers, and shelter management to support operations</li>
  <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Animals depend on consistent, reliable care—volunteer commitment directly impacts welfare</li>

<h4>Seven Years of Consistent Life-Saving Donations</h4>
<p>Since beginning regular blood donation as a high school junior in 2018, have contributed over 120 units of platelet and whole blood to Bloodworks Northwest. This sustained commitment represents hundreds of hours spent in donation centers and direct impact on hundreds of patients receiving critical transfusions. Unlike one-time volunteer events, blood donation requires ongoing health maintenance, reliable scheduling, and willingness to endure discomfort for strangers' benefit.</p>

<h4>Why Platelets Over Whole Blood</h4>
<p>After initial whole blood donations (~5% of total), transitioned to platelet-focused donation strategy (~95% of contributions). Platelets are blood components critical for clotting—essential for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, trauma victims, surgical patients, and those with blood disorders. Unlike whole blood (donated every 8 weeks), platelets can be donated every 2 weeks due to rapid regeneration, enabling more frequent contribution.</p>

<p>Platelet donation is significantly more involved than whole blood:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Time Commitment:</strong> 2.5-3 hours per session (108 minutes connected to apheresis machine, plus setup and post-donation monitoring)</li>
  <li><strong>Apheresis Process:</strong> Blood drawn from one arm, platelets separated via centrifuge, remaining blood components returned through other arm</li>
  <li><strong>Physical Demands:</strong> Must remain still during procedure, potential side effects include tingling (calcium depletion), fatigue, and discomfort from extended immobilization</li>
  <li><strong>Eligibility Requirements:</strong> Stricter health screening than whole blood—requires consistent iron levels, platelet count, blood pressure, and overall health</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite increased time and discomfort, platelet donation provides greater patient impact—each donation can help 1-3 patients compared to whole blood's single-patient use. Choosing this path demonstrated commitment to maximizing community health contribution.</p>

<h4>Donation Frequency & Consistency</h4>
<p>Established goal during high school: donate every 2 weeks without exception. This schedule represented upper limit of allowable frequency and required disciplined health maintenance (adequate sleep, hydration, iron-rich diet) to maintain eligibility. Continued regular donations through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High school academic demands and extracurricular activities</li>
  <li>Military enlistment and training schedules</li>
  <li>Full-time college coursework at Oregon State University</li>
  <li>Professional figure skating tour with Disney on Ice (coordinating across cities)</li>
  <li>Multiple relocations requiring identification of new donation centers</li>
</ul>

<p>Recent years have seen reduced frequency due to scheduling conflicts and distance from preferred donation centers, but commitment remains—still donate when circumstances allow rather than abandoning practice entirely.</p>

<h4>Challenges & Persistence</h4>
<p><strong>System Migration Data Loss:</strong> Bloodworks Northwest transitioned backend systems during COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in loss of historical donation records and milestone tracking. While frustrating to lose documented progress toward recognition milestones (gallon clubs, donor awards), continued donating despite reset counter—reinforcing that motivation comes from patient impact, not personal recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-Facility Donations:</strong> Life transitions (moving for school, military, touring) necessitated donations across different Bloodworks locations and sometimes different blood service organizations. This fragmented donation history across multiple systems, making comprehensive tracking difficult. Maintained commitment despite lack of unified record—demonstrating that doing the right thing matters regardless of credit or recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility Maintenance:</strong> Frequent donation requires vigilance about health factors affecting eligibility: maintaining adequate iron levels through diet, avoiding medications that defer donation, managing cold/illness to minimize deferrals, and scheduling around tattoos, piercings, or travel that temporarily disqualifies donors. Each donation represents not just 3 hours in the chair, but ongoing lifestyle choices supporting eligibility.</p>

<h4>Patient Impact</h4>
<p>Over 120 unit donations directly supported:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cancer Patients:</strong> Chemotherapy destroys bone marrow's platelet production; transfusions prevent life-threatening bleeding</li>
  <li><strong>Trauma Victims:</strong> Major injuries cause massive platelet consumption; emergency transfusions enable survival</li>
  <li><strong>Surgical Patients:</strong> Complex surgeries require platelet reserves to manage bleeding complications</li>
  <li><strong>Blood Disorder Patients:</strong> Conditions like aplastic anemia or ITP require regular platelet support</li>
</ul>

<p>Each donation potentially helps 1-3 patients. Conservative estimate: 120+ units = 150-300 individuals directly impacted. Some patients receive transfusions once; others (cancer patients undergoing extended treatment) require repeated support.</p>

<h4>Why This Matters</h4>
<p>Blood donation is one of few volunteer activities where individual contribution has immediate, measurable, life-saving impact. Unlike many forms of service where outcomes are diffuse or long-term, donated platelets enter a patient's bloodstream within days, directly enabling their survival or recovery. This tangible connection between action and outcome provides powerful motivation to maintain commitment despite inconvenience.</p>

<p>Moreover, platelet donors are relatively rare—most people donate whole blood (if they donate at all), and fewer than 10% pursue platelet donation due to time commitment and eligibility requirements. This makes regular platelet donors disproportionately valuable to blood supply infrastructure. Hospitals rely on consistent donor pools to maintain adequate inventory; donors who establish reliable 2-week schedules become foundational to that supply chain.</p>

<h4>Reflection on Service</h4>
<p>Seven years of blood donation taught lessons applicable beyond the donation center:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consistency Over Intensity:</strong> Small actions repeated regularly create greater impact than dramatic one-time efforts</li>
  <li><strong>Service Despite Inconvenience:</strong> Meaningful contribution often requires personal sacrifice—time, discomfort, schedule disruption</li>
  <li><strong>Health as Responsibility:</strong> Maintaining eligibility required treating body as resource for others' benefit</li>
  <li><strong>Quiet Impact:</strong> Most effective service happens without fanfare—patients never know their donor's name</li>
</ul>

<p>This work exemplifies servant leadership principle: putting others' needs above personal comfort, consistently and without expectation of recognition.</p>

<h4>Program Overview: Kids Helping Kids</h4>
<p>The Lancer Pageant is Churchill High School's contribution to Kids Helping Kids—a regional tradition spanning 18+ mid-Willamette Valley high schools since 1993. This competitive fundraising program benefits Children's Miracle Network at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend, supporting local children requiring specialized medical care, advanced equipment, and family support services. Over three decades, student-led pageants have become the single largest donor source for CMN at Sacred Heart, demonstrating sustained community commitment to pediatric healthcare.</p>

<h4>Six-Month Campaign Structure</h4>
<p>Participated as one of 10 senior contestants in 2019 Lancer Pageant, supported by 8 coordinators managing logistics and backend operations. Campaign spanned six months with intensive fundraising, community engagement, and public performance requirements. Competition evaluated contestants on fundraising effectiveness, community involvement, overall effort, and program support—creating friendly rivalry that maximized charitable impact while building leadership skills.</p>

<h4>Fundraising Activities & Community Outreach</h4>
<p>Engaged in multi-faceted fundraising strategy reaching diverse community touchpoints:</p>

<p><strong>School Assemblies (Monthly):</strong> Performed at school-wide assemblies approximately once per month, combining entertainment with fundraising appeals. These high-visibility events raised awareness among student body, faculty, and parents while generating direct donations. Required public speaking comfort and ability to engage large audiences.</p>

<p><strong>Restaurant & Business Partnerships (Weekly):</strong> Coordinated weekly outreach events with local restaurants and chain establishments. Typical format: restaurant designated percentage of evening sales to CMN, contestants promoted event through social media and direct community engagement, attended to thank customers and explain cause. Built relationships with local business community while providing mutual benefit (charity support + customer traffic).</p>

<p><strong>Street-Side Fundraising:</strong> Conducted direct donation campaigns at high-traffic locations. Required overcoming discomfort of approaching strangers, clearly articulating cause value, and maintaining enthusiasm despite rejection. Developed sales/persuasion skills and resilience.</p>

<p><strong>Major Event Nights:</strong> Participated in large-scale fundraising events including collaboration with University of Oregon's CMN team, creating connection between high school and collegiate philanthropic efforts. These events featured coordinated entertainment, auctions, and community engagement activities.</p>

<h4>Performance & Public Engagement</h4>
<p>Contestants learned 3-4 choreographed dance routines performed throughout campaign at assemblies, fundraising events, and community appearances. Dance performances served dual purpose: entertaining audiences while demonstrating contestant commitment and team coordination. Required rehearsal discipline, performance under pressure, and ability to maintain energy across dozens of public appearances.</p>

<h4>Culminating Talent Show & Community Celebration</h4>
<p>Campaign concluded with annual large-scale community event featuring individual talent performances, interactive games, and final fundraising total reveal. This well-attended evening provided opportunity for contestants to showcase creativity, thank supporters, and celebrate collective achievement.</p>

<h4>Engineering Challenge: Custom YMCA Costume Design</h4>
<p>For talent show performance, designed and fabricated custom wearable apparatus enabling solo performance of YMCA group dance—traditionally requiring five performers. This engineering project combined mechanical design, material selection, and iterative prototyping:</p>

<p><strong>Structural Design:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Repurposed school backpack as wearable harness, shoulder straps fastened to chest for load distribution</li>
  <li>Two vertical steel poles mounted to backpack serving as primary support structure</li>
  <li>Additional steel rods connecting performer's limbs to dummy limbs for coordinated movement</li>
  <li>Load analysis to ensure structure supported four dummy assemblies without excessive weight or instability</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dummy Fabrication Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Material selection: Insulation foam for low cost, light weight, and ease of shaping</li>
  <li>Hand-cut foam body segments shaped to approximate human proportions</li>
  <li>Layered foam construction for dimensional depth and structural integrity</li>
  <li>Joints created using bamboo skewers as pins with zip-tie loops enabling articulation</li>
  <li>Assembly secured with combination of tape, glue, and mechanical fasteners</li>
  <li>Paint and costume application matching YMCA video dancers for visual authenticity</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mechanical Linkage System:</strong> Steel rods connected performer's arms and legs to corresponding dummy limbs, translating human movement to four synchronized puppet figures. This mechanical advantage enabled realistic dance movements while maintaining structural stability during dynamic motion. System required careful balance between rigidity (maintaining position) and flexibility (allowing natural movement).</p>

<p><strong>Challenges & Solutions:</strong> Initial prototyping revealed issues with dummy weight distribution causing backpack harness discomfort and limited range of motion. Iterative adjustments redistributed load, shortened lever arms where excessive, and reinforced weak joints. Final design operated nearly flawlessly during performance—only significant drawback was substantial foam dust generated during fabrication process (garage cleanup required).</p>

<p>This project demonstrated applied engineering problem-solving: defining requirements (solo YMCA performance), conceptual design (research existing solutions), detailed design (structural calculations and material selection), fabrication (hands-on construction), testing (iteration and refinement), and successful deployment (public performance). Experience reinforced that engineering extends beyond classroom—creative problem-solving applies anywhere constraints meet objectives.</p>

<h4>Competition Results & Recognition</h4>
<p>Selected as 2019 Lancer Pageant winner based on evaluation criteria: fundraising contribution, community involvement, demonstrated effort, and program support. While individual fundraising totals were not tracked (all donations immediately pooled to emphasize collaboration over competition), judges assessed overall impact through observation of event attendance, leadership during activities, and sustained engagement throughout six-month campaign.</p>

<p>Served as informal leader and point-of-contact during events—when participants or attendees needed direction, often became go-to resource for answers and coordination. This organic leadership role emerged from consistent presence, thorough understanding of event logistics, and willingness to step up when situations required decisive action.</p>

<h4>Collective Impact</h4>
<p>2019 Lancer Pageant raised approximately $33,000 for Children's Miracle Network at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center. These funds directly supported:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advanced pediatric medical equipment enabling specialized treatment locally</li>
  <li>Family support services helping parents navigate medical crises</li>
  <li>Facility improvements enhancing patient care environment</li>
  <li>Programs keeping families together during extended hospitalization</li>
</ul>

<p>$33,000 represents tangible, measurable impact on local children's healthcare—enabling treatments, reducing family financial burden, and improving outcomes for patients who otherwise might require distant specialized care.</p>

<h4>Continued Involvement</h4>
<p>Despite limited post-graduation volunteer opportunities within program structure (designed for current students), continue attending annual Lancer Pageant events as alumni supporter. Ongoing involvement demonstrates that commitment extended beyond personal participation—value the cause itself and want to support current students carrying forward this tradition.</p>
