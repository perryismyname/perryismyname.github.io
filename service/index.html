<h4>Volunteer Service Overview</h4>
<p>Contributed 235 hours of volunteer service to Greenhill Humane Society across multiple roles supporting animal care, surgical operations, and emergency response. Started as small animal caretaker and progressed to surgical suite responsibilities, demonstrating increasing trust and capability. Service spanned several years with consistent weekly commitment to animal welfare and shelter operations.</p>

<h4>Primary Role: Surgical Suite Assistant</h4>
<p>Majority of volunteer time spent supporting veterinary surgical operations through instrument sterilization, facility preparation, and post-operative animal monitoring. This behind-the-scenes role was critical to maintaining surgical throughput and ensuring safe, sterile procedures for spay/neuter operations and emergency surgeries.</p>

<p><strong>Instrument Processing & Sterilization:</strong> Received used surgical instruments from operating rooms and processed them through complete cleaning and sterilization cycle. Responsibilities included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial cleaning and decontamination of blood, tissue, and biological material from instruments</li>
  <li>Inspection for damage or wear that could compromise surgical safety</li>
  <li>Proper assembly of instrument packs based on procedure requirements (spay kits, neuter kits, emergency surgical sets)</li>
  <li>Packaging instruments in sterilization pouches with appropriate indicators</li>
  <li>Operating autoclave equipment following strict time/temperature/pressure protocols</li>
  <li>Verifying sterilization success through indicator strip validation</li>
  <li>Organizing and storing sterile packs with proper rotation to ensure freshness</li>
</ul>

<p>This work required meticulous attention to detail—improperly sterilized instruments could lead to post-operative infections, while damaged instruments could compromise surgical outcomes. Learned importance of procedural discipline and how small oversights cascade into larger problems.</p>

<p><strong>Facility Preparation & Maintenance:</strong> Supported daily surgical operations through morning prep and end-of-day cleaning. Morning duties included preparing sterilization materials, restocking surgical suites with required supplies, and ensuring equipment was ready for veterinary staff. End-of-day responsibilities involved thorough cleaning and disinfection of surgical rooms, proper disposal of biological waste, and restocking for next day's operations. Maintained clean, organized environment essential for safe veterinary procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Post-Operative Animal Monitoring:</strong> Observed animals in recovery areas following anesthesia and surgery. Watched for signs of distress, abnormal behavior, or complications requiring veterinary attention. Alerted nursing staff immediately when animals exhibited concerning symptoms (prolonged unconsciousness, labored breathing, unusual vocalizations). This monitoring role required understanding normal vs. abnormal recovery patterns and recognizing when professional intervention was needed.</p>

<h4>Small Animal Care Unit</h4>
<p>Entry-level position where volunteer service began. Responsible for daily care of rescued small animals including rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, and other species awaiting adoption. Duties included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Daily feeding and water provision appropriate to species dietary needs</li>
  <li>Supervised exercise and socialization time outside enclosures</li>
  <li>Habitat cleaning and bedding replacement to maintain sanitary conditions</li>
  <li>Behavioral observation and enrichment activities to reduce stress</li>
  <li>Documentation of health concerns or behavioral changes for veterinary review</li>
</ul>

<p>This role taught responsibility for living creatures dependent on consistent care. Missing a feeding or failing to clean properly directly impacted animal health and adoption readiness. Learned to follow structured care protocols and maintain detailed records.</p>

<h4>Cat Care & Deep Cleaning Support</h4>
<p>Provided backup support to cat care team during high-volume periods or staff shortages. Performed deep cleaning of cat housing areas—a physically demanding task requiring thorough disinfection, litter management, and environmental sanitization. This work was critical during disease outbreak prevention efforts when contamination control became essential to protect entire cat population.</p>

<h4>Emergency Relief Support</h4>
<p>Activated during regional wildfire emergencies when evacuated residents brought animals to designated shelter points. Oregon's wildfire season creates urgent need for emergency animal housing, feeding, and supply distribution. Volunteer role included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transporting donated supplies (food, bedding, crates, medications) to emergency evacuation centers</li>
  <li>Organizing and inventorying emergency supply stockpiles</li>
  <li>Assisting with temporary animal housing setup at evacuation sites</li>
  <li>Monitoring supply levels and coordinating replenishment as needed</li>
  <li>Supporting displaced pet owners during high-stress emergency situations</li>
</ul>

<p>Emergency response work demonstrated importance of preparedness, logistics coordination, and calm professionalism during crisis. Seeing families reunited with evacuated pets reinforced the community service value of volunteer work.</p>

<h4>Skills and Values Developed</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Procedural Discipline:</strong> Sterilization protocols required exact adherence to procedures—shortcuts risk animal health</li>
  <li><strong>Attention to Detail:</strong> Instrument inspection, animal monitoring, and cleaning standards all demand careful observation</li>
  <li><strong>Compassion Under Stress:</strong> Working with sick, injured, or frightened animals requires patience and empathy</li>
  <li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Coordinating with veterinary staff, fellow volunteers, and shelter management to support operations</li>
  <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Animals depend on consistent, reliable care—volunteer commitment directly impacts welfare</li>
  <li><strong>Crisis Response:</strong> Emergency situations require adaptability, clear communication, and focus on immediate needs</li>
</ul>

<h4>Impact and Reflection</h4>
<p>235 hours of service supported hundreds of surgical procedures, cared for dozens of small animals awaiting adoption, and assisted multiple emergency response operations. This work reinforced understanding that behind every adopted animal is extensive support infrastructure—veterinary care, cleaning, feeding, socialization, and logistics. Volunteer experience demonstrated how consistent individual contributions aggregate into significant community impact.</p>
