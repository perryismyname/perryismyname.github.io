<h4>Seven Years of Consistent Life-Saving Donations</h4>
<p>Since beginning regular blood donation as a high school junior in 2018, have contributed over 120 platelet and whole blood donations to Bloodworks Northwest. This sustained commitment represents hundreds of hours spent in donation centers and direct impact on hundreds of patients receiving critical transfusions. Unlike one-time volunteer events, blood donation requires ongoing health maintenance, reliable scheduling, and willingness to endure discomfort for strangers' benefit.</p>

<h4>Why Platelets Over Whole Blood</h4>
<p>After initial whole blood donations (~5% of total), transitioned to platelet-focused donation strategy (~95% of contributions). Platelets are blood components critical for clotting—essential for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, trauma victims, surgical patients, and those with blood disorders. Unlike whole blood (donated every 8 weeks), platelets can be donated every 2 weeks due to rapid regeneration, enabling more frequent contribution.</p>

<p>Platelet donation is significantly more involved than whole blood:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Time Commitment:</strong> 2.5-3 hours per session (108 minutes connected to apheresis machine, plus setup and post-donation monitoring)</li>
  <li><strong>Apheresis Process:</strong> Blood drawn from one arm, platelets separated via centrifuge, remaining blood components returned through other arm</li>
  <li><strong>Physical Demands:</strong> Must remain still during procedure, potential side effects include tingling (calcium depletion), fatigue, and discomfort from extended immobilization</li>
  <li><strong>Eligibility Requirements:</strong> Stricter health screening than whole blood—requires consistent iron levels, platelet count, blood pressure, and overall health</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite increased time and discomfort, platelet donation provides greater patient impact—each donation can help 1-3 patients compared to whole blood's single-patient use. Choosing this path demonstrated commitment to maximizing community health contribution.</p>

<h4>Donation Frequency & Consistency</h4>
<p>Established goal during high school: donate every 2 weeks without exception. This schedule represented upper limit of allowable frequency and required disciplined health maintenance (adequate sleep, hydration, iron-rich diet) to maintain eligibility. Continued regular donations through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High school academic demands and extracurricular activities</li>
  <li>Military enlistment and training schedules</li>
  <li>Full-time college coursework at Oregon State University</li>
  <li>Professional figure skating tour with Disney on Ice (coordinating across cities)</li>
  <li>Multiple relocations requiring identification of new donation centers</li>
</ul>

<p>Recent years have seen reduced frequency due to scheduling conflicts and distance from preferred donation centers, but commitment remains—still donate when circumstances allow rather than abandoning practice entirely.</p>

<h4>Challenges & Persistence</h4>
<p><strong>System Migration Data Loss:</strong> Bloodworks Northwest transitioned backend systems during COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in loss of historical donation records and milestone tracking. While frustrating to lose documented progress toward recognition milestones (gallon clubs, donor awards), continued donating despite reset counter—reinforcing that motivation comes from patient impact, not personal recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-Facility Donations:</strong> Life transitions (moving for school, military, touring) necessitated donations across different Bloodworks locations and sometimes different blood service organizations. This fragmented donation history across multiple systems, making comprehensive tracking difficult. Maintained commitment despite lack of unified record—demonstrating that doing the right thing matters regardless of credit or recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility Maintenance:</strong> Frequent donation requires vigilance about health factors affecting eligibility: maintaining adequate iron levels through diet, avoiding medications that defer donation, managing cold/illness to minimize deferrals, and scheduling around tattoos, piercings, or travel that temporarily disqualifies donors. Each donation represents not just 3 hours in the chair, but ongoing lifestyle choices supporting eligibility.</p>

<h4>Patient Impact</h4>
<p>Over 120 platelet donations directly supported:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cancer Patients:</strong> Chemotherapy destroys bone marrow's platelet production; transfusions prevent life-threatening bleeding</li>
  <li><strong>Trauma Victims:</strong> Major injuries cause massive platelet consumption; emergency transfusions enable survival</li>
  <li><strong>Surgical Patients:</strong> Complex surgeries require platelet reserves to manage bleeding complications</li>
  <li><strong>Blood Disorder Patients:</strong> Conditions like aplastic anemia or ITP require regular platelet support</li>
</ul>

<p>Each donation potentially helps 1-3 patients. Conservative estimate: 120+ donations = 150-300 individuals directly impacted. Some patients receive transfusions once; others (cancer patients undergoing extended treatment) require repeated support. This network effect means contribution extends far beyond simple multiplication.</p>

<h4>Why This Matters</h4>
<p>Blood donation is one of few volunteer activities where individual contribution has immediate, measurable, life-saving impact. Unlike many forms of service where outcomes are diffuse or long-term, donated platelets enter a patient's bloodstream within days, directly enabling their survival or recovery. This tangible connection between action and outcome provides powerful motivation to maintain commitment despite inconvenience.</p>

<p>Moreover, platelet donors are relatively rare—most people donate whole blood (if they donate at all), and fewer than 10% pursue platelet donation due to time commitment and eligibility requirements. This makes regular platelet donors disproportionately valuable to blood supply infrastructure. Hospitals rely on consistent donor pools to maintain adequate inventory; donors who establish reliable 2-week schedules become foundational to that supply chain.</p>

<h4>Reflection on Service</h4>
<p>Seven years of blood donation taught lessons applicable beyond the donation center:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consistency Over Intensity:</strong> Small actions repeated regularly create greater impact than dramatic one-time efforts</li>
  <li><strong>Service Despite Inconvenience:</strong> Meaningful contribution often requires personal sacrifice—time, discomfort, schedule disruption</li>
  <li><strong>Intrinsic Motivation:</strong> Continuing after data loss demonstrated commitment rooted in values rather than external recognition</li>
  <li><strong>Health as Responsibility:</strong> Maintaining eligibility required treating body as resource for others' benefit</li>
  <li><strong>Quiet Impact:</strong> Most effective service happens without fanfare—patients never know their donor's name</li>
</ul>

<p>This work exemplifies servant leadership principle: putting others' needs above personal comfort, consistently and without expectation of recognition.</p>

<h4>Volunteer Service Overview</h4>
<p>Contributed 235 hours of volunteer service to Greenhill Humane Society across multiple roles supporting animal care, surgical operations, and emergency response. Started as small animal caretaker and progressed to surgical suite responsibilities, demonstrating increasing trust and capability. Service spanned several years with consistent weekly commitment to animal welfare and shelter operations.</p>

<h4>Primary Role: Surgical Suite Assistant</h4>
<p>Majority of volunteer time spent supporting veterinary surgical operations through instrument sterilization, facility preparation, and post-operative animal monitoring. This behind-the-scenes role was critical to maintaining surgical throughput and ensuring safe, sterile procedures for spay/neuter operations and emergency surgeries.</p>

<p><strong>Instrument Processing & Sterilization:</strong> Received used surgical instruments from operating rooms and processed them through complete cleaning and sterilization cycle. Responsibilities included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial cleaning and decontamination of blood, tissue, and biological material from instruments</li>
  <li>Inspection for damage or wear that could compromise surgical safety</li>
  <li>Proper assembly of instrument packs based on procedure requirements (spay kits, neuter kits, emergency surgical sets)</li>
  <li>Packaging instruments in sterilization pouches with appropriate indicators</li>
  <li>Operating autoclave equipment following strict time/temperature/pressure protocols</li>
  <li>Verifying sterilization success through indicator strip validation</li>
  <li>Organizing and storing sterile packs with proper rotation to ensure freshness</li>
</ul>

<p>This work required meticulous attention to detail—improperly sterilized instruments could lead to post-operative infections, while damaged instruments could compromise surgical outcomes. Learned importance of procedural discipline and how small oversights cascade into larger problems.</p>

<p><strong>Facility Preparation & Maintenance:</strong> Supported daily surgical operations through morning prep and end-of-day cleaning. Morning duties included preparing sterilization materials, restocking surgical suites with required supplies, and ensuring equipment was ready for veterinary staff. End-of-day responsibilities involved thorough cleaning and disinfection of surgical rooms, proper disposal of biological waste, and restocking for next day's operations. Maintained clean, organized environment essential for safe veterinary procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Post-Operative Animal Monitoring:</strong> Observed animals in recovery areas following anesthesia and surgery. Watched for signs of distress, abnormal behavior, or complications requiring veterinary attention. Alerted nursing staff immediately when animals exhibited concerning symptoms (prolonged unconsciousness, labored breathing, unusual vocalizations). This monitoring role required understanding normal vs. abnormal recovery patterns and recognizing when professional intervention was needed.</p>

<h4>Small Animal Care Unit</h4>
<p>Entry-level position where volunteer service began. Responsible for daily care of rescued small animals including rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, and other species awaiting adoption. Duties included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Daily feeding and water provision appropriate to species dietary needs</li>
  <li>Supervised exercise and socialization time outside enclosures</li>
  <li>Habitat cleaning and bedding replacement to maintain sanitary conditions</li>
  <li>Behavioral observation and enrichment activities to reduce stress</li>
  <li>Documentation of health concerns or behavioral changes for veterinary review</li>
</ul>

<p>This role taught responsibility for living creatures dependent on consistent care. Missing a feeding or failing to clean properly directly impacted animal health and adoption readiness. Learned to follow structured care protocols and maintain detailed records.</p>

<h4>Cat Care & Deep Cleaning Support</h4>
<p>Provided backup support to cat care team during high-volume periods or staff shortages. Performed deep cleaning of cat housing areas—a physically demanding task requiring thorough disinfection, litter management, and environmental sanitization. This work was critical during disease outbreak prevention efforts when contamination control became essential to protect entire cat population.</p>

<h4>Emergency Relief Support</h4>
<p>Activated during regional wildfire emergencies when evacuated residents brought animals to designated shelter points. Oregon's wildfire season creates urgent need for emergency animal housing, feeding, and supply distribution. Volunteer role included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transporting donated supplies (food, bedding, crates, medications) to emergency evacuation centers</li>
  <li>Organizing and inventorying emergency supply stockpiles</li>
  <li>Assisting with temporary animal housing setup at evacuation sites</li>
  <li>Monitoring supply levels and coordinating replenishment as needed</li>
  <li>Supporting displaced pet owners during high-stress emergency situations</li>
</ul>

<p>Emergency response work demonstrated importance of preparedness, logistics coordination, and calm professionalism during crisis. Seeing families reunited with evacuated pets reinforced the community service value of volunteer work.</p>

<h4>Skills and Values Developed</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Procedural Discipline:</strong> Sterilization protocols required exact adherence to procedures—shortcuts risk animal health</li>
  <li><strong>Attention to Detail:</strong> Instrument inspection, animal monitoring, and cleaning standards all demand careful observation</li>
  <li><strong>Compassion Under Stress:</strong> Working with sick, injured, or frightened animals requires patience and empathy</li>
  <li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Coordinating with veterinary staff, fellow volunteers, and shelter management to support operations</li>
  <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Animals depend on consistent, reliable care—volunteer commitment directly impacts welfare</li>
  <li><strong>Crisis Response:</strong> Emergency situations require adaptability, clear communication, and focus on immediate needs</li>
</ul>

<h4>Impact and Reflection</h4>
<p>235 hours of service supported hundreds of surgical procedures, cared for dozens of small animals awaiting adoption, and assisted multiple emergency response operations. This work reinforced understanding that behind every adopted animal is extensive support infrastructure—veterinary care, cleaning, feeding, socialization, and logistics. Volunteer experience demonstrated how consistent individual contributions aggregate into significant community impact.</p>
