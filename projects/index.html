<h4>Project Overview</h4>
<p>My senior capstone project represents the culmination of my involvement with Global Formula Racing's powertrain team. Rather than pursuing a traditional classroom-based capstone, I chose to embed myself in GFR's manufacturing and testing workflow to gain real-world production engineering experience. This project bridges academic theory with hands-on manufacturing, quality control, and system integration.</p>

<h4>Scope & Responsibilities</h4>
<p>My role encompasses the complete production cycle for formula car components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Receive CAD models from the design team (both OSU and DHBW Germany)</li>
  <li>Evaluate designs for manufacturability and recommend modifications to reduce cost or improve fabrication feasibility</li>
  <li>Manufacture components using composites, metals, and electronics assembly techniques</li>
  <li>Conduct quality inspections and dimensional verification against engineering drawings</li>
  <li>Install components on the vehicle and integrate with existing systems</li>
  <li>Participate in vehicle testing to validate performance and identify failure modes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technical Challenges</h4>
<p><strong>Design for Manufacturing:</strong> Formula SAE designs prioritize performance and weight reduction, sometimes at the expense of manufacturability. My role involves identifying where tolerances can be relaxed, materials substituted, or geometries simplified without compromising function. This requires understanding both the design intent and the limitations of available manufacturing processes.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-Material Fabrication:</strong> Projects span composites layup (carbon fiber, fiberglass), precision metal machining (aluminum brackets, steel fasteners), and electronics assembly (wiring harnesses, sensor integration). Each material system demands different skills, tooling, and quality control methods.</p>

<p><strong>International Collaboration:</strong> Working with DHBW Germany introduces logistical complexity—parts designed overseas must be manufacturable with OSU's equipment, and communication across time zones requires clear documentation and proactive problem-solving.</p>

<h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
<p>This capstone develops skills directly applicable to production engineering roles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Design for Manufacturing (DFM) principles and cost-conscious engineering decisions</li>
  <li>Multi-process manufacturing (composites, machining, assembly)</li>
  <li>Quality assurance and inspection procedures</li>
  <li>System integration and troubleshooting in complex electromechanical systems</li>
  <li>Cross-functional communication with designers, testers, and international partners</li>
  <li>Project documentation and engineering change management</li>
</ul>

<h4>Current Status</h4>
<p>Project is ongoing through Winter and Spring 2026 terms. Specific components, test results, and final deliverables will be added as work progresses. Anticipated focus areas include battery enclosure manufacturing, powertrain cooling system fabrication, and high-voltage wiring harness assembly.</p>

<h4>Project Background</h4>
<p>The DMC2 Mini is a desktop CNC mill kit designed for precision metalworking in a compact footprint. Rather than purchasing a turnkey machine, I chose to build from a kit to deeply understand every mechanical and electrical system. This hands-on assembly process taught me how linear motion systems, closed-loop servo control, spindle dynamics, and machine rigidity contribute to final part accuracy.</p>

<h4>Technical Specifications</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Working Envelope:</strong> 12" (X) × 7" (Y) × 5.5" (Z)</li>
  <li><strong>Spindle:</strong> 3 HP (2.2kW), 24,000 RPM with ER20 collet system</li>
  <li><strong>Motion System:</strong> Closed-loop servo motors on precision ball screws and linear rails</li>
  <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 0.0014mm theoretical (microstepping dependent)</li>
  <li><strong>Achieved Tolerance:</strong> ±0.01mm on aluminum and mild steel with proper finishing passes</li>
  <li><strong>Controller:</strong> Mach3 with custom configuration for servo tuning</li>
  <li><strong>Features:</strong> Automatic XYZ probing, central lubrication system, 40 PSI high-pressure coolant, internal chip management</li>
</ul>

<h4>Build & Tuning Process</h4>
<p><strong>Assembly (Weeks 1-3):</strong> Kit assembly required precise alignment of linear rails, ball screw installation, electrical wiring of closed-loop servo drives, spindle mounting, and coolant system integration. Each component's installation directly impacts final accuracy—rail misalignment or loose fasteners translate to positioning errors.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Testing & Troubleshooting (Weeks 4-8):</strong> First test cuts revealed several issues: servo tuning was too aggressive (causing oscillation), spindle tramming was off (producing tapered parts), and work holding wasn't rigid enough (causing chatter). Systematic troubleshooting involved adjusting PID parameters in Mach3, re-tramming the spindle with a dial indicator, upgrading vise clamping, and experimenting with feeds/speeds for different materials.</p>

<p><strong>Precision Tuning (Months 3-6):</strong> Achieving ±0.01mm tolerance required iterative refinement: backlash compensation in software, mechanical preload adjustment on ball screws, thermal management (machine warm-up cycles), tool runout minimization, and developing finishing pass strategies. Each improvement was validated through test part measurement using calipers and micrometers.</p>

<h4>Materials & Applications</h4>
<p>The DMC2 Mini excels at aluminum and mild steel, with tested success on 6061-T6 aluminum alloys, 1018 mild steel, brass, and various plastics. Typical projects include custom brackets for engineering projects, precision jigs and fixtures, replacement parts for equipment repair, prototype components for design validation, and tooling for other manufacturing processes.</p>

<h4>Key Learning Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Machine Dynamics:</strong> How rigidity, vibration damping, and thermal stability affect machining accuracy</li>
  <li><strong>Servo Control Systems:</strong> PID tuning, closed-loop feedback, and stall detection implementation</li>
  <li><strong>G-Code Programming:</strong> CAM software (Fusion 360) workflow and post-processor customization for Mach3</li>
  <li><strong>Feeds & Speeds Optimization:</strong> Balancing material removal rate, tool life, and surface finish</li>
  <li><strong>Troubleshooting Methodology:</strong> Systematic diagnosis of mechanical vs. electrical vs. software issues</li>
  <li><strong>Metrology:</strong> Precision measurement techniques and tolerance verification procedures</li>
</ul>

<h4>Business Application</h4>
<p>This CNC mill serves as the primary manufacturing tool for my LLC, which focuses on precision component manufacturing and custom fabrication services. The ability to produce parts in-house enables rapid prototyping, cost-effective small-batch production, and direct control over quality and lead times.</p>

<h4>Ongoing Improvements</h4>
<p>Current enhancement projects include: integrating a fourth-axis rotary table for complex geometries, implementing tool length measurement for automatic offset compensation, upgrading to flood coolant for improved chip evacuation, and exploring LinuxCNC as an alternative controller with advanced features.</p>

<h4>Project Context</h4>
<p>As part of Introduction to Design (ME 382), our class collaboratively designed and built a multi-stage Rube Goldberg machine where each student team contributed one subsystem. My subsystem—Step #2 in the assembly—receives input from the previous team's ball launcher and delivers output to trigger the next stage. This project required applying the complete engineering design process: problem definition, stakeholder analysis, concept generation, functional modeling, CAD development, physics-based simulation, prototyping, testing, and iterative refinement.</p>

<h4>Subsystem Design: Servo-Activated Zipline Mechanism</h4>
<p>The final design uses a servo motor to release a weighted basket that travels down a 24-inch zipline, converting potential energy into kinetic energy to trigger the next stage. The mechanism consists of:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Input:</strong> Redirecting cone guides incoming ball onto a trigger button</li>
  <li><strong>Actuation:</strong> Button press activates servo motor that releases basket latch</li>
  <li><strong>Energy Transfer:</strong> 0.5 lb basket accelerates down angled zipline under gravity</li>
  <li><strong>Output:</strong> Basket impact depresses second button, triggering next subsystem</li>
</ul>

<h4>Engineering Design Process (Four Phases)</h4>
<p><strong>Phase 1 - Problem Definition & Stakeholder Analysis:</strong> Researched existing zipline and gravity-driven mechanisms, identified stakeholder needs (reliability, timing, safety, ease of reset), and developed measurable design requirements. Analyzed similar Rube Goldberg subsystems to understand failure modes and success factors.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2 - Concept Generation & Selection:</strong> Generated multiple design alternatives through functional decomposition and morphological analysis. Compared concepts using a decision matrix weighted by stakeholder priorities. Developed House of Quality to link customer needs to engineering specifications. Selected servo-activated zipline for optimal balance of reliability, controllability, and mechanical simplicity.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 3 - Detailed Design & Validation:</strong> Created full CAD assembly in SolidWorks with motion studies to verify clearances and travel paths. Performed physics calculations to determine required zipline angle, basket mass, and release height for consistent triggering. Built physical prototype and conducted iterative testing to validate simulations and refine trigger sensitivity.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 4 - Testing, Evaluation & Reflection:</strong> Collected quantitative performance data across multiple test runs. Analyzed failure modes and success rates. Gathered peer feedback and expert evaluation. Documented lessons learned and provided specific recommendations for future design improvements.</p>

<h4>Technical Challenges & Solutions</h4>
<p><strong>Timing Consistency:</strong> Initial tests showed high variability in basket travel time due to friction inconsistencies. Solution: Added Teflon washers to zipline contact points and implemented consistent basket loading procedure.</p>

<p><strong>Trigger Reliability:</strong> Ball occasionally missed input cone due to positional variation from previous subsystem. Solution: Enlarged cone opening and added alignment guides to increase capture tolerance.</p>

<p><strong>System Integration:</strong> Coordinating with adjacent teams required careful dimensional control and communication. Solution: Established interface control documents specifying input/output positions, trigger forces, and timing windows.</p>
