    involvement="<p><strong>Global Formula Racing (GFR) - Powertrain Team</strong><br>
Active member of OSU's international formula racing team, which collaborates with Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg (DHBW) in Germany to design and build competition vehicles across nine time zones. Work on the powertrain team encompasses the complete electric drivetrain system—from battery integration to motor control. Responsibilities include designing and fabricating battery management systems (BMS), battery enclosures and mounting structures, high-voltage bus bars, custom wiring harnesses, motor cooling systems, and electrical interconnects. Projects involve CAD design, manufacturing planning, and hands-on assembly as the team develops autonomous electric race vehicles for Formula SAE competition. Gained experience in high-voltage safety protocols, PCB design principles, and low-voltage control system integration.</p>
<p><strong>OSU Machine Shop Experience</strong><br>
Extensive hands-on work in the university machine shop, operating manual mills, lathes, and CNC equipment. Fabricated custom parts for senior design projects and provided technical support to undergraduate engineering students. Developed proficiency in precision measurement, G-code programming, and manufacturing planning.</p>

<p><strong>Senior Capstone Project (In Progress)</strong><br>
Currently beginning senior design project—details to be added as project scope develops through Winter and Spring 2026 terms.</p>"
    detail="<h4>Why Robotics & Control Systems?</h4>
<p>The Robotics & Control Systems option combines mechanical design with electrical systems integration, automation, and intelligent control—exactly the skillset needed for modern manufacturing and mechatronics applications. This specialization aligns with my hands-on experience in avionics, CNC programming, and embedded systems development.</p>

<h4>Academic Philosophy</h4>
<p>Maintaining a 3.86 GPA while balancing military service, professional athletics (Disney on Ice), and technical club involvement required disciplined time management and genuine passion for engineering. I approach coursework not as boxes to check, but as foundations for practical application. Theoretical concepts become meaningful when applied to real projects—whether troubleshooting F-15 avionics, programming CNC mills, or designing battery cooling systems for formula racing.</p>

<h4>Hands-On Learning</h4>
<p>The most valuable education happens outside the classroom. Machine shop work taught me how designs translate to manufacturability. Formula racing showed me how theoretical thermodynamics governs real cooling system performance. Military avionics work demonstrated how electrical theory becomes troubleshooting practice. Each experience reinforces classroom learning and reveals gaps to address through further study.</p>

<h4>Transfer Student Journey</h4>
<p>Transferring to OSU with three associate degrees reflects a non-linear path to engineering. Starting in pre-med, pivoting during COVID, and committing fully to engineering required persistence and adaptability. Arriving at OSU with strong math/science foundations and diverse coursework background allowed me to focus on major-specific technical depth while bringing broader perspective to team projects.</p>"

  <p class="section-intro">Three associate degrees demonstrating academic breadth and commitment to transfer preparation</p>
  
  {% include entry-education.html 
    degree="Associate of Science (AS)"
    institution="Lane Community College"
    dates="Completed 2021"
    highlights="<ul>
      <li>Focused on mathematics, physics, and engineering prerequisites</li>
      <li>Prepared for seamless transfer to Oregon State University engineering program</li>
      <li>Completed lower-division engineering coursework and laboratory requirements</li>
    </ul>"
    detail="<p>The Associate of Science degree provided the rigorous math and science foundation required for upper-division engineering coursework. Completing calculus sequence, physics series, chemistry, and introductory engineering courses at Lane Community College ensured I arrived at OSU prepared for immediate immersion in major-specific content.</p>

<p>This pathway also demonstrated financial prudence and strategic planning—completing general education and foundational technical courses at community college before transferring to a four-year institution for specialized engineering training.</p>"

  {% include entry-education.html 
    degree="Associate of Arts Oregon Transfer (AAOT)"
    institution="Lane Community College"
    dates="Completed 2020"
    highlights="<ul>
      <li>Originally pursued pre-medical pathway before pivoting to engineering</li>
      <li>Block-transfer degree meeting lower-division general education requirements</li>
      <li>Transferred with junior standing for registration purposes</li>
    </ul>"
    detail="<p>The AAOT degree reflects my initial academic direction toward healthcare and biological sciences. While my career goals shifted dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, the broad liberal arts foundation—writing, social sciences, humanities—developed communication and critical thinking skills that complement technical engineering work.</p>

<p>This experience taught me the value of intellectual flexibility and the importance of pursuing work aligned with genuine interest rather than inertia. Recognizing a poor fit early and pivoting decisively demonstrated self-awareness and commitment to finding the right path.</p>"

  {% include entry-education.html 
    degree="Associate of General Studies (AGS)"
    institution="Lane Community College"
    dates="Completed 2021"
    detail="<p>The AGS degree was awarded through the combination of AAOT coursework (humanities, social sciences, arts) and AS coursework (mathematics, natural sciences, engineering). This degree represents the breadth of my community college education and the comprehensive preparation for university transfer.</p>"
