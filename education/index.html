<p><strong>Global Formula Racing (GFR) - Powertrain Team & Senior Capstone</strong><br>
Initially joined GFR's powertrain team through OSU's student organization, working on CAD revisions and basic machining projects for the electric formula car. After discovering genuine interest in production manufacturing, I proposed expanding this involvement into my senior capstone project, transitioning from occasional tasks to comprehensive manufacturing engineering responsibility. My capstone now focuses on the complete production cycle: receiving engineering drawings from the design team (OSU and DHBW Germany), evaluating designs for manufacturability and recommending modifications to improve fabrication feasibility, precision machining components to demanding tolerances (±0.025mm / ±0.001"), managing press fits and sub-thousandth tolerances on manual mills and lathes with DROs, conducting quality inspections and dimensional verification, assembling components onto the vehicle, participating in testing to validate performance, and iterating on failed or underperforming parts. Most components require 1-2 press fits and 2-5 features held to sub-thou tolerances. These are actual production parts for competition, not student practice pieces. The project culminates in spring 2026 with final vehicle assembly, system integration testing, and competition readiness validation. This capstone provides hands on manufacturing engineering experience rarely available in traditional classroom based senior projects.</p>

<p><strong>OSU Machine Shop Experience</strong><br>
Extensive hands on work in the university machine shop, operating manual mills, lathes, and CNC equipment. Fabricated custom parts for senior design projects and provided technical support to undergraduate engineering students. Developed proficiency in precision measurement, G-code programming, and manufacturing planning.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Senior Capstone Project Status</strong><br>
Currently in progress through Winter and Spring 2026 terms. Project focuses on manufacturing for production rather than design from scratch, emphasizing DFM evaluation, tight tolerance machining, quality control, and iterative testing workflows common in production engineering roles.</p>

<h4>Why Robotics & Control Systems?</h4>
<p>The Robotics & Control Systems option combines mechanical design with electrical systems integration, automation, and intelligent control. This is exactly the skillset needed for modern manufacturing and mechatronics applications. This specialization aligns with my hands on experience in avionics, CNC programming, and embedded systems development.</p>

<h4>Academic Philosophy</h4>
<p>Maintaining a 3.86 GPA while balancing military service, professional athletics (Disney on Ice), and technical club involvement required disciplined time management and genuine passion for engineering. I approach coursework not as boxes to check, but as foundations for practical application. Theoretical concepts become meaningful when applied to real projects, whether troubleshooting F-15 avionics, programming CNC mills, or designing battery cooling systems for formula racing.</p>

<h4>Hands On Learning</h4>
<p>The most valuable education happens outside the classroom. Machine shop work taught me how designs translate to manufacturability. Formula racing showed me how theoretical thermodynamics governs real cooling system performance. Military avionics work demonstrated how electrical theory becomes troubleshooting practice. Each experience reinforces classroom learning and reveals gaps to address through further study.</p>

<h4>Transfer Student Journey</h4>
<p>Transferring to OSU with three associate degrees reflects a non-linear path to engineering. Starting in pre-med, pivoting during COVID, and committing fully to engineering required persistence and adaptability. Arriving at OSU with strong math/science foundations and diverse coursework background allowed me to focus on major specific technical depth while bringing broader perspective to team projects.</p>

    detail="<h4>Program Overview</h4>
<p>Air Force avionics technical training is an intensive, accelerated program equivalent to associate level technical coursework, condensed into approximately six months of instruction. The curriculum covers electrical theory, digital systems, RF communications, radar principles, and systematic troubleshooting methodology, all applied specifically to operational military aircraft systems. Graduates earn the 2A3X4 AFSC (Tactical Aircraft Maintenance - Avionics) and are qualified to work on mission critical flight systems.</p>

<h4>Academic Rigor & Recognition</h4>
<p>Being recognized as AETC Top Graduate required maintaining the highest academic performance across all written examinations, practical assessments, and hands on evaluations throughout the program. This achievement reflects not only technical aptitude but also the ability to learn complex systems quickly under high pressure conditions. The training pace demands immediate absorption and application of material. There's no time for passive learning.</p>

<h4>Leadership Development</h4>
<p>Serving as Black Rope Squadron Lead meant managing the drill and ceremonies program for over 100 airmen while simultaneously completing demanding technical coursework. This dual responsibility required exceptional time management, delegation skills, and the ability to maintain standards under competing pressures. Coordinating daily formations, scheduling duty rotations, and ensuring squadron wide military bearing standards taught me operational leadership distinct from academic achievement alone.</p>

<h4>Practical Application</h4>
<p>Unlike traditional classroom education, Air Force technical training emphasizes immediate practical application. Every theoretical concept (Ohm's Law, signal propagation, circuit analysis) was immediately applied to actual aircraft systems during hands on work sessions. This approach develops troubleshooting intuition and reinforces the connection between theory and real world problem solving. Learning to work with live electrical systems, high voltage equipment, and safety critical components instilled disciplined work habits and attention to detail that directly transfer to precision engineering work.</p>

<h4>Cross-Disciplinary Foundation</h4>
<p>This training bridges electrical and mechanical engineering domains, providing perspective on electromechanical integration that complements my mechanical engineering education. Understanding how sensors interface with control systems, how environmental factors affect electrical performance, and how human factors influence system design informs better engineering decisions across disciplines.</p>
