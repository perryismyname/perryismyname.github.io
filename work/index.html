  title="Fighter Aircraft Integrated Avionics Specialist"
  company="Oregon Air National Guard, 142nd Fighter Wing"
  dates="2021 - Present"
  location="Portland, OR"
  image="/img/portfolio/6.jpg"
  bullet1="Maintain, troubleshoot, and repair F-15 integrated avionics systems including radar, communications, navigation, engine monitoring, and defensive countermeasures"
  bullet2="Diagnose complex electrical issues through pilot debriefs, ground replication, technical manual research, and systematic troubleshooting procedures"
  bullet3="Perform scheduled preventative maintenance and operational checks on critical flight systems to ensure mission readiness"
  bullet4="Train and mentor junior airmen in technical procedures, safety protocols, and strict USAF tool accountability standards"
  bullet5="Earned AETC Top Graduate Award during technical training and promoted to Staff Sergeant (5-level technician)"
  outcome="Maintained rigorous safety and quality standards across hundreds of maintenance actions with zero tool accountability violations"
  detail="<h4>Technical Scope</h4>
<p>As a 5-level avionics technician, I am qualified to independently diagnose and repair all pilot-interface electrical systems on the F-15 platform. This includes fuel quantity indication, radar systems, multi-mode communications, engine instrumentation, chaff/flare dispensing systems, helmet-mounted displays, and numerous cockpit controls. My work directly impacts pilot situational awareness and mission capability.</p>

<h4>Troubleshooting Process</h4>
<p>When pilots report discrepancies, I gather detailed information through structured debriefs, attempt to replicate issues on the ground, and analyze technical documentation to identify potential failure modes. Using wiring diagrams, data flow analysis, and test equipment, I systematically isolate root causes, perform component-level repairs or replacements, conduct operational checks to verify fixes, and document all work in official maintenance records before releasing aircraft back to service.</p>

<h4>Safety & Accountability</h4>
<p>Aviation maintenance demands absolute adherence to Foreign Object Debris (FOD) prevention and tool control procedures. I maintain meticulous inventory tracking, follow strict safety protocols, and ensure all work complies with technical orders and Air Force instructions. These habits translate directly to precision engineering work in civilian applications.</p>

<h4>Leadership Development</h4>
<p>As a Staff Sergeant and senior technician, I now mentor junior airmen through their qualification training. This involves breaking down complex technical concepts, demonstrating proper procedures, and fostering a culture of attention to detail and professional excellence. Teaching others has reinforced my own technical understanding and developed my communication skills.</p>

<h4>Skills Developed</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Advanced electrical troubleshooting and circuit analysis</li>
  <li>Technical documentation interpretation (wiring diagrams, schematics, technical orders)</li>
  <li>Test equipment operation (multimeters, oscilloscopes, signal generators, BITE systems)</li>
  <li>Root cause analysis and systematic problem-solving</li>
  <li>Clear technical communication with pilots and maintenance leadership</li>
  <li>Strict adherence to quality control and safety procedures</li>
  <li>Mentoring and knowledge transfer</li>
